Welcome to the JavaScript Dice Game! ðŸŽ²

## Overview

This project is a duo-player dice game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game follows these rules and mechanics:

1. **Game Rules & Mechanics**:
   - Two players take turns rolling a six-sided die.
   - The player with the highest roll wins the round.
   - If a player rolls a 1, their current score resets to zero, and the turn switches to the other player.
   - Players can choose to "hold" their current score to add it to their total score.

2. **User Interactions**:
   - Buttons for "Roll Dice," "Hold," and "New Game" trigger corresponding game mechanics.
   - The game state is dynamically displayed on the webpage.

3. **DOM Manipulation**:
   - The player names, current scores, and total scores are updated in real-time.
   - Dice images change based on the rolled value.

4. **Game State Management**:
   - The game keeps track of each player's score, whose turn it is, and who has won.
